# Roller Coaster Simulation #

Two versions of animation included, one with the "sky" texture and one with the "water" texture. Please feel free to view either one / both.

Keyboard/Mouse controls: (Please document Keyboard/Mouse controls if any)
1. Space bar is a pause button, which allows for the camera motion to stop moving along the track
2. To translate the scene, you have to use the 't' button binding, since I have a mac device
